# Liri-Node-App
A Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data, using APIs for Spotify, OMDB, and Bandsintown.com.

## Project Goals

This project serves to build more experience building Node.JS applications that incorporate multiple packages and API calls. The interface ought to be easy to use and understand, and allow the user to search and browse search returns for the various API calls.

### Challenges

The biggest challenge I faced was figuring out precisely how the different APIs packaged their data and how to access the data points I needed. I also spent a good amount of time working out the project flow, but by gradually breaking my operations into functions that can be re-used in creative ways, that task became much easier to complete.

### Successes

I'm most proud of working out my functions and providing them helpful names. I enjoyed the power and ease of use of Inquirer to develop a nice flow and re-call of search options. Figuring out how to present a list of additional options was an interesting problem to solve, and works better than I imagined!
